**Title:** Female Representation in Film: Does Girl Power Translate to
Profit

**Motivation For the project:** â€œThe Bechdel Test is a simple and
popular measure of feminism in works of fiction. The rules of the test
were first defined back in 1985 in a comic strip featuring two queer
women who could not find a movie that: Has at least two women in it, who
talk to each other, about something other than a man. It is an indicator
of the active presence of women in the entire field of film and other
fiction and calls attention to gender inequality in fiction. Some
studies indicate that films that pass the test perform better
financially while receiving a lower budget, compared to those that do
not. Thus, through this project, we intend to examine the relationship
between representation in movies and movie budget/profit

**Intended final products:**

-   Trend of Bechdel test scores for movies by year from 2000 to 2020
-   Relationship between Bechdel test score and the movie budget
-   Relationship between Bechdel test score and the movie gross profit
-   Sub-analysis examining stratified relationship between Bechdel test
    score and movie budget/profit per genre.
-   Out of some of the most profitable films, how many pass the bechdel
    test
-   Trends between Bechdel test scores and metacritic review scores, and
    Bechdel test scores and IMDB review scores

**Anticipated data sources:** There are a number of datasets we intend
to pull from:

-   [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bechdel/movies.csv):
    contains year of release, IMDB ID, title, Bechdel test scores,
    budget(inflation adjusted), domestic/international gross revenue.
-   [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/): budget, rating,
    revenue, cast, and crew. Data can be accessed through an API
-   [Bechdeltest.com](https://bechdeltest.com/): Film database with
    Bechdel test results.

**Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges:** Planned analyses
include correlation tests between Bechdel test scores and various
indicators such as budget, gross profit, metacritic scores, IMDB scores,
as well as stratified analyses by movie genre. We will also create
visualizations for these analyses as well as for the trend of movies
passing the Bechdel test over time. Some challenges include cleaning and
merging the datasets. We are pulling data from multiple sources and
formats, we will have to tidy and combine the sources. We will also pull
data from IMDB using CSS Selector.
