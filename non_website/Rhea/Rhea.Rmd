## linear models

### Linear regression of budget vs. categorical Bechdel score



```{r}
budget_dist_p = movies_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = budget_2013)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Count",
    y = "Budget ($, 2013-adjusted)",
    title = "Distribution of movie budgets")

ggplotly(budget_dist_p)
```

Since budget is heavily right skewed, we log-transformed the data instead to enforce more normal distributions. We quantitatively tested the association of budget with categorical Bechdel score by regressing budget against the categories. 

```{r budget}

log_budget= movies_df %>%
  lm(log(budget_2013)~bechdel_score, data=.) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

```
Based on parameter estimate of -0.31003 with a p value of 0.01, it can be observed  that movies passing all 3 Bechdel dimensions have significantly lower budgets than movies failing every dimension of Bechdel test.

Movies that failed every Bechdel dimension had an average budget of $33,963,942
Movies that passed all 3 Bechdel dimensions had an average budget of $24,910,750

### Linear regression of profit vs. categorical Bechdel score

```{r}
profit_dist = movies_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = profit)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Count",
    y = "Profit",
    title = "Distribution of Profits")

ggplotly(profit_dist)
```


In the graph, profit appears to be heavily right skewed. Thus we log-transformed the data to enforce more normal distributions. Additionaly, before the logarithm is applied, 1 was added to the base value to prevent applying a logarithm to a 0 value. This 1 will be subtracted while calculating the results.

We quantitatively tested the association of profit with categorical Bechdel score by regressing profit against the categories adjusting for budget


```{r}


profit = movies_df %>% 
  lm(log(profit+1)~bechdel_score+log(budget_2013), data =.)

summary(profit)

```
Based on the parameter estimates, it can be observed that movies that pass all dimensions of the bechdel test have lower profits than movies that fail all 3 dimensions of the bechdel test, adjusting for budget. However since the p-value is 0.7 > 0.05, the difference is statistically insignificant


### Linear regression of IMDB rating vs. categorical Bechdel score
…
```{r}
imdb = movies_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = imdb_rating)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Count",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    title = "Distribution of IMDB")

ggplotly(imdb)
```
The graph shows an approximately normal distribution.

Testing association of IMDB rating with categorical bechdel scores using linear regression

```{r}
imdb = movies_df %>% 
  lm(imdb_rating~bechdel_score, data=.)

summary(imdb)
```
Based on the Parameter estimate of -0.344 with a p value of 0.00019,
movies that pass all the dimensions of Bechdel test have 0.344 point lower IMDB rating than mobies that fail all the dimensions of a Bechdel test.

### Linear regression of Meta score vs. categorical Bechdel score

```{r}
meta = movies_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = metascore)) + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Count",
    y = "meta score",
    title = "Distribution of Metascore")

ggplotly(meta)
```
The graph shows an approximately normal distribution.

Testing association of meta score with categorical bechdel scores using linear regression

```{r}
meta = movies_df %>% 
  lm(metascore~bechdel_score, data=.)

summary(meta)

```
Based on the parameter estimates, it can be observed that movies that pass all dimensions of the bechdel test have lower profits than movies that fail all 3 dimensions of the bechdel test, adjusting for budget. However since the p-value is 0.7 > 0.05, the difference is statistically insignificant
