<div id="data-sources-and-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Sources and Overview</h2>
<p>The source of the dataset comes from R for Data Science’s <a
href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-03-09">Tidy
Tuesday Project</a>, which provides weekly releases of raw datasets for
users to wrangle and analyze. The data itself originates from
FiveThirtyEight, containing movies ranging from 1970 to 2013, and merges
data from several sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://imdb.com">IMDB</a></strong>: Provides
information about each film, such as year, runtime, genre, language,
rating.</li>
<li><strong><a
href="http://bechdeltest.com">BechdelTest.com</a></strong>: Provides
year, title, and a Bechdel Test score ranging from 0-3.</li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://The-Numbers.com">The-Numbers.com</a></strong>: Provides
information about budget and revenue of each movie.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-import-and-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Import and Cleaning</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>raw_bechdel = read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/raw_bechdel.csv&#39;)
movies = read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/movies.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The dataset was distributed in two files, <code>movies.csv</code>,
<code>raw_bechdel.csv</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>movies.csv</code>: A data file of 1794 observations and 34
variables, which includes movies from 1970 to 2013, and contains
variables for title, IMDB ID, year, Bechdel test (uncleaned, cleaned,
binary pass/fail), genres, ratings, budget, domestic and international
gross revenue, and 2013-adjusted budget and revenues.</li>
<li><code>raw_bechdel.csv</code>: A data file of 8839 observations and 5
variables, containing movies from 1888 to 2021, and contains variables
for title, movie ID, IMDB ID, and raw Bechdel test score (0 to 3).</li>
</ul>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data cleaning</h3>
<p>The data cleaning steps involve the following: - Converting character
to numeric variables for <code>domgross</code>, <code>intgross</code>,
<code>domgross_2013</code>, <code>intgross_2013</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Converting the <code>binary</code> character variable to a
logical variable that indicates whether the movie passes or fails the
Bechdel Test</p></li>
<li><p>Recoding and relevelling the numeric <code>decade_code</code>
variable into a <code>decade</code> factor variable according to the
year of release</p></li>
<li><p>Recoding and relevelling the <code>clean_test</code> variable
into 4 levels corresponding to the Bechdel Test criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = Less than 2 women</li>
<li>1 = Women don’t talk to each other</li>
<li>2 = Women only talk about men</li>
<li>3 = Dubious (uncertain whether it passes Bechdel Test)</li>
<li>4 = Passes Bechdel Test</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Creating a <code>profit</code> variable, the difference between
2013-adjusted domestic revenue less budget</p></li>
</ul>
<p>=======</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating variables for profit and ROI for each movie. For this, we
will use worldwide box office revenue instead of domestic revenue.
<ul>
<li><code>profit</code> = <code>intgross_2013 – budget_2013</code></li>
<li><code>ROI</code> = <code>profit / budget_2013</code></li>

<li>Renaming key variables to relevant names</li>

need to run a Kruskal-Wallace test in place of an F-test. Below are the
