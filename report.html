<h1>Female Representation in Film: Does Girl Power Translate to
Success?</h1>
<div id="topic" class="section level3">
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>An analysis of movies released between 1970-2013 that pass the
Bechdel test, and looking at their association with movie budget,
profit, and other factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The <strong>Bechdel test</strong> is an <em>indicator of the active
presence of women</em> in the entire field of <em>film</em> and other
fiction, and calls attention to <em>gender inequality</em> in fiction.
Some studies indicate that films that pass the test perform better
financially while receiving a lower budget, compared to those that do
not. Thus, through this project, we intend:</p>
<ul>
<li>To examine the number of movies that pass the Bechdel test over time
(1970 - 2013)</li>
<li>To examine the relationship between female representation in movies
and movie budget</li>
<li>To examine the relationship between female representation in movies
and movie profit</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="inspiration" class="section level3">
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Female representation is growing by day in every sector, with
particular attention given to it in film. We, a group of movie
nerdgirls, wanted to look for progressive movies that signify higher
representation of women or where women are completely centered in the
story. The Bechdel Test has been a simple and popular measure of
feminism in works of fiction. The rules of the test were first defined
back in 1985 in a comic strip featuring two queer women who could not
find a movie that</p>
<ul>
<li>Had at least two women in it</li>
<li>who talked to each other,</li>
<li>about something other than a man.</li>
</ul>
<p>We came across articles talking about the importance of these tests
in the industry, and some previous studies that used this test to
determine if the movie had significant representation for female
character(s). Using this information, we further wanted to explore the
prioritization of these movies in the industry and their success through
an examination of their budget, profits, and ratings.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<p>Initially, our motivation for this project was prompted by the
following questions: * How many movies from 1970-2013 pass the Bechdel
test and has the number changed over time? * What is the association
between the movies that pass the Bechdel test and the movie’s budget? *
What is the association between the movies that pass the Bechdel test
and the movie’s profit?</p>
<p>As we delved into the data, we further wanted to explore: * What is
the association between movies that pass the Bechdel test and their
review ratings?</p>
</div>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>FiveThirtyEight</strong>: The <em>FiveThirtyEight Bechdel
dataset</em> contains data about 1794 films released from 1970 to 2013.
We used this data to examine the relationship between the prominence of
women in a film and that film’s budget and profits. The dataset consists
of variables including <code>title</code>, <code>year</code>,
<code>budget</code>, domestic and international gross revenue, budget
and revenues adjusted for 2013 inflation, and the Bechdel test
(evaluated both as binary pass/fail and categorically evaluating the
three criteria).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bechdel Test</strong>: This database consists of a list
of 9802 movies released between 1874 and 2022 (as of Dec 8th, 2022), and
results for whether they pass or fail the Bechdel test. Variables
include <code>title of the film</code>, <code>date</code> when the film
was added, <code>reviews and comments</code>, and
<code>IMDB ratings</code>. The data can be accessed through
API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The-Numbers</strong>: This is a film industry data
website that tracks box office revenue in a systematic and algorithmic
way. We accounted for the <code>budget</code> and <code>revenue</code>
variables for the movies using this website. The data can be accessed
through API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IMDb</strong>: The <em>Internet Movie Database</em>
(IMDb) is an online database containing information and statistics about
movies, TV shows, and video games as well as actors, directors, and
other film industry professionals. We used the information about the
<code>year of release</code>, <code>runtime</code>, <code>genre</code>,
<code>language</code> and <code>rating</code> of the films.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tidy Tuesday Project</strong>: This is the <em>main
source for our dataset</em> which provides weekly releases of raw
datasets for users to wrangle and analyse. The data itself
<em>originates from FiveThirtyEight</em> that contains movies ranging
from 1970 to 2013, and <em>merges data from the other sources: IMDb,
The-Numbers.com, and BechdelTest.com</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>We imported the following datasets from the Tidy Tuesday project
using <code>read_csv</code> from ‘readr’ library. This dataset was
divided into 2 files: <strong><code>movies.csv</code></strong> and
<strong><code>raw_bechdel.csv</code></strong>, initially.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>raw_bechdel = readr::read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/raw_bechdel.csv&#39;)
movies = readr::read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-09/movies.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We mainly used <strong>movies.csv</strong> for our analysis.
<strong>movies.csv</strong> included movies from 1970 to 2013; and
contains the following variables <strong>year, imdb, title, test,
clean_test, binary, budget, domgross, intgross, code, budget_2013,
domgross_2013, intgross_2013, period_code, decade_code, imdb_id, plot,
rated, response, language, country, writer, metascore, imdb_rating,
director, released, actors, genre, awards, runtime, type, poster,
imdb_votes, error</strong></p>
<p>For data cleaning,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We checked for the variables and converted the following
variables from character to numeric form as
required:<code>domgross</code>, <code>intgross</code>,
<code>domgross_2013</code>, <code>intgross_2013</code> using as.numeric
function in the tidyverse library.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘binary’ variable in character form was converted to logical
form to indicate whether the movie had passed or failed the Bechdel
test.</p></li>
<li><p>Numeric ‘Decade_code’ variable was re-coded and re-leveled into a
factor <code>decade</code> variable according to the year of release. 5
levels were created for this ‘decade’ variable ranging from 1970-79,
1980-89, 1990-99, 2000-09, 2010 to 2013.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-coded and re-leveled the <code>clean_test</code> variable into
4 levels corresponding to the Bechdel Test criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = Less than 2 women</li>
<li>1 = Women don’t talk to each other</li>
<li>2 = Women only talk about men</li>
<li>3 = Dubious (uncertain whether it passes Bechdel Test)</li>
<li>4 = Passes Bechdel Test</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Created an <code>award_winner</code> variable that is
<code>TRUE</code> if the movie has won at least 1 Oscar, Golden Globe,
or BAFTA award</p></li>
<li><p>Split the <code>genre</code> character variable into dummy-coded
variables indicating whether the movie falls under up to three of 20
different genres</p></li>
<li><p>Created a logical variable <code>pass_bechdel</code> that
indicates whether the movie passes or fails the Bechdel Test based on
the <code>bechdel_score</code> variable</p></li>
<li><p>Created <code>profit</code> and <code>ROI</code> variables for
movies. We used worldwide box office revenue instead of domestic
revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>profit</code> = <code>intgross_2013 – budget_2013</code></li>
<li><code>ROI</code> = <code>profit / budget_2013</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Renamed key variables to relevant names, and removed extra
variables</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The findings suggested that over half of the movies,
i.e. <strong>52.7%</strong> movies in the data <strong>passed</strong>
the Bechdel Test. Stratifying by levels of Bechdel scores, it was seen
that among the movies that passed the test, a small proportion had a
dubious passing status. Among those that failed the test, most movies
had women who didn’t talk to each other.</p>
<p>We conducted a further exploratory data analysis to answer our main
questions:</p>

<p>This concluded that the proportion of movies that passed the Bechdel
test increased over the decades. Due to a smaller sample of movies in
the last decade (2010-13), we that the results seemed to have had
leveled-off since 2000s. Also, the proportion of movies that decisively
passed the test is still below 50%.</p>

<p>It was seen that the movies that passed the Bechdel test appeared to

categorical Bechdel score, the budgets were not significantly different
from each other. This possibly suggests that Hollywood puts more money
behind male-only films than films in which women talk to each other.</p>

<p>Movies failing the Bechdel test seemed to make more profit as
compared to the ones that passed the test. The distribution of these
profits across movies that passed and failed the Bechdel test was not
appreciably different. Upon stratifying, there were no notable
differences in the profits between Bechdel criteria.</p>

<h4>4. How do the <strong><em>movies that pass the Bechdel’s test
associate with the ROI</em></strong>?</h4>
<p>We also checked for ROI to check for the ratio of profit to the
budget (2013 inflation). Because ROI was heavily right-skewed, we used
log-transform for this variable to visualize differences in the ROI
distribution between movies of differing Bechdel criteria.</p>

<p>Despite having slightly lower budgets, we could see that the primacy
of women’s roles in movies did not negatively impact movies’ financial
performance. This contradicts the claims that films with stronger female
characters perform any worse at the box office than films without
them.</p>

<h4>5. How do the <strong><em>movies that pass the Bechdel’s test
associate with the IMDb ratings</em></strong>?</h4>
<p>We wanted to see how the fans received the movies that passed the
Bechdel test. We plotted IMDB ratings (fan ratings) against Metacritic
Scores (aggregate scores based on critic reviews) and stratified by
Bechdel Score.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>movies_df %&gt;% 
  plot_ly(x = ~imdb_rating, y = ~metascore/10, color = ~bechdel_score, type = &quot;scatter&quot;,

  layout(yaxis = list(title = list(text = &quot;Metascore&quot;, standoff = 5), gridcolor = &quot;lightgray&quot;),
         xaxis = list(title = &quot;IMDB Rating&quot;), gridcolor = &quot;gray&quot;,

<p>There was no appreciable difference between the movies that pass and
fail the Bechdel test in terms of their performance. There were more
films passing the Bechdel Test with higher critic ratings relative to
fan ratings, and more films that failed the Bechdel Test with lower
critic ratings relative to fan ratings. One potential reason can be
inherent biases held by fans to be more critical of films with
female-dominant roles, while critics may be more likely to isolate their
own biases while judging films.</p>

<p>To test and determine the strength of association, we used linear
regression models for <code>categorical Bechdel score</code> with
outcomes <code>budget</code>, <code>profit</code>,
<code>imdb_rating</code> and <code>Metascores</code> individually.</p>
<p><em>For these linear models, we used the
<code>"less than 2 women"</code> as the reference category.</em> The
intercept was used to compare movies that fail all dimensions of the
Bechdel test with the movies that pass all dimensions of the Bechdel
test.</p>

<p>Because the budget was heavily right skewed, we log-transformed it to

<h3>Stepwise Regression</h3>
<p>We used stepwise regression to check if the Bechdel score was an
influential predictor of movie performance as measured by
<code>profit</code>, <code>budget_2013</code>, and review ratings. The
setup of the regression models here follows the methodology utilized for
the linear regression models including log-transforming variables like
<code>profit</code> and <code>budget_2013</code> to enforce a normal
distribution. For the review rating variable, we had a choice of using
the Metacritic scores or the IMDB scores. Because
<code>imdb_rating</code> proved to be statistically significantly
associated with the Bechdel test in the linear regression analysis, we
decided to use this variable over the <code>metascore</code>. We
utilized a stepwise algorithm that optimized model AIC from the
<code>MASS</code> package. First, we tested both the binary and
categorical variables for the Bechdel test in the algorithm. Upon
running the models, we found that the binary variable was more likely to
be selected as a part of the final model due to having fewer degrees of
freedom, so that became the variable used in the final models.
Initially, we included return on investment, <code>ROI</code> as an
outcome variable as well, but after running the models, we found that it
displayed the same results as the <code>profit</code> variable. Because
of this, it was removed from the final analyses.</p>
<p>We first assessed the Bechdel test as a potential predictor of
<code>profit</code>. Other potential predictors included in the model
were <code>budget_2013</code>, <code>imdb_rating</code>, and all genre
variables.</p>

<p>The Bechdel test was selected as an influential predictor only for
<code>imdb_rating</code> and not for <code>profit</code> or
<code>budget_2013</code>. The IMDB ratings for movies that passed the
Bechdel test were lower on average than for movies that failed. Based on
this, passing the Bechdel test can be considered a neutral to negative
factor to a movie’s potential success.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>At first, we explored the proportion of the movies from our dataset
that passed the Bechdel test. We then also wanted to see if there was a
change in the trend over time for the proportion of movies that passed
the Bechdel test. We saw that <strong>52.7%</strong> movies in the data
<strong>passed</strong> the Bechdel test. There was also an increase in
the proportion of movies that passed the Bechdel test over each
decade.</p>
<p>For further analysis, we tried to measure the success of these movies
based on factors like the budget, profit, and their IMDb ratings. While
looking at these associations, we saw that the movies that passed the
test had lower budgets and made lesser profits as compared to those that
failed the test. Additionally, the movies that passed and failed the
test had no appreciable difference between the IMDb ratings. On
stratifying, there were more films that passed the Bechdel test and had
higher critic ratings (compared to general audience ratings), and there
were more films that failed the Bechdel test with lower critic ratings
relative to audience ratings. This was suggestive of inherent biases
held by general audiences that make them more critical of films with
female-dominant roles, while critics may have been more likely to
isolate these biases while judging films.</p>
<p>We found that a movie passing the Bechdel test plays an influential
role in predicting IMDb ratings, but not profits or budget. Movies that
pass the Bechdel test, on average, have lower ratings than movies that
fail.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while not all results were statistically significant,
our analysis pointed to a similar pattern, where passing the Bechdel
test had a negative influence on our measures of success.</p>
<div id="superheroes-bonus" class="section level4">
<h4>Superheroes Bonus</h4>
<p>The <code>Superheroes</code> dataset was obtained using the Selector
Gadget Chrome Extension. <br> We created a custom <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls566366989/">IMDB</a> list containing
all released movies from Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as one for
the DC Extended Universe. Several DC Superheroes movies not in the
Extended Universe were also added. Using the Selector Gadget, we pulled
variables <code>title</code> and <code>year</code>. <br> Data on budget,
domestic and international gross was pulled using the Selector Gadget
from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films">Wikipedia</a>.
<br> Data on the Bechdel test results for each movie was merged from our
<code>movies_df</code> dataframe, as well as <a
href="https://bechdeltest.com/">bechdeltest.com</a>. <br></br> The
datasets obtained from each website were cleaned and merged to create
the Superheroes_finally.xlsx file used for the Superheroes dashboard.
<br></br> The Dashboard contains 2 graphs. One is depicting the
proportion of movies that pass the Bechdel test in the DC Universe and
the Marvel universe, represented as a bar plot. We can observe that
marvel has a higher percentage of movies that pass the test. <br> The
second graph depicts movies that pass the test over the years. The
purpose of this scatter plot is to see the cluster of movies that pass
the test is bigger post-2016 compared to before 2016, while no movie
passed the test before 2008. This trend shows that the amount of
superhero movies passing the Bechdel test is increasing. <br> finally,
we put the search table in the dashboard for the user to easily be able
to look at which movies passed the Bechdel test and which failed.</p>
